Shared code used by multiple Accura Tweaks ([@AccuraTweaks](http://twitter.com/accuratweaks/)) products. *Requires ARC*.

Contains custom Preference Cells,  an UIView Category for easy (CALayer) animations with custom timing functions, and two classes that help getting information about installed packages and creating information for support mails. 

Still heavy work in progress, but working so far.
